# gtunnel
## a smart script for making one, two or more reverse ssh tunnel, always open and reliable ##

I make this script because my RaspberryPI at home is behind an internet connection that not offer to me IP. This script (in *php language*) making tunnels direct to a public server and expose a local port to a remote port. In this way you can connect to a remote server to the remote port.... and you can connect to the local raspberry in the local port.

## Installing PHP ##

This script want php-cli installed

'''console
sudo apt-get install php
'''
